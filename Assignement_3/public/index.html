        In this game we start by showing you a film, from this film you have to find a person (actor or produceur)
        related to this film. If you do and if it's correct, we will show you information about the person you choose and you will have to find
        a movie related to this person. And we will keep doing this forever !
        You can't use the same person/movie twice.
